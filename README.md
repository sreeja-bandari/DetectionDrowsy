# Driver Drowsiness Detection System
This code can detect your eyes and alert when the user is DROWSY.

## Applications 
This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to Accidents.

### Code Requirements 
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 

### Dependencies

1) import cv2
2) import imutils
3) import dlib
4) import scipy


## Description ðŸ“Œ

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

## Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye.

It checks 20 consecutive frames and if the Eye Aspect ratio is less than 0.25, Alert is generated.
